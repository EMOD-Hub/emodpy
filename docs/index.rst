=====================
Welcome to |EMODPY_s|
=====================

|EMODPY_s| is a collection of Python scripts and utilities created to
streamline user interactions with |EMOD_s| and |IT_s|. Additional
functionality  for interacting with |EMOD_s| is provided in the
:doc:`emod_api:emod_api_index` and  :doc:`idmtools:idmtools_index` packages.

See :doc:`idmtools:index` for a diagram showing how |IT_s| and each of the
related packages are used in an end-to-end workflow using |EMOD_s| as the
disease transmission model.

.. not sure what to do with catalyst. Not included yet.

.. nothing done with STAMP yet; not sure if it will be some sort of "plug-in" to the tools or totally standalone

.. Nothing here for EMOD API. We'll want to put it *somewhere* and likely have a landing page for it here...
