# Welcome to emodpy

The emodpy package is a collection of Python scripts for using EMOD. It integrates the configuring of EMOD with idmtools ability to run a model on different platforms. Typical use of emodpy is as part of a disease specific package like [emodpy-malaria][emodpy-malaria] or [emodpy-hiv][emodpy-hiv].


See [idmtools documentation][idmtools] for a diagram showing how idmtools and each of the related packages are used in an end-to-end workflow using EMOD as the disease transmission model.

## Installation

The emodpy package is currently available on a [Python package index server][idm_pypi] managed by the [Institute for Disease Modeling][idmod].

```
pip install emodpy --extra-index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple
```
